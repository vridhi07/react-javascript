<!--debouncing and throttling are techniques used to control the rate at which a -->
<!--function is executed in response to rapid or continuous events, such as user input or window resizing-->

<!--//Debouncing ensures that a function is only called once after a specified period of inactivity.-->
<!--//Search input: Triggering an API call only after the user has stopped typing for a certain amount of time.-->
<!--//Window resize events: Recalculating layout or fetching data only after the user has finished resizing the window.-->

<!--Throttling ensures that a function is called at most once in a specified time period, -->
<!--regardless of how many times the event occurs.-->
<!--Scroll events: Handling infinite scrolling or lazy loading content as the user scrolls.-->
<!--Button clicks: Preventing multiple rapid clicks that might cause unintended behavior.-->

<!--Debouncing: Executes the function only once after a specified period of inactivity.-->
<!--Throttling: Executes the function at regular intervals during continuous events.-->
