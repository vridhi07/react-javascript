7. Reverse a Word (example a good day => day good a without inbuilt functions)
8. Netherlands flag problem (sort array of 0's and 1's in n time complexity without creating new array)
9. filter unique values from array without creating new 
10. Length of longest unique substring (n complexity)
11. find the longest unique substring (n complexity)
12. find rotation point in a sorted array (n log n complexity binary search)
13. [1,2,3,4,5,6] => [6,5,4,1,2,3] transform array without in built functions

15. print missing number in array [6,7,10,11,13] 
16. Capitilize first letter in array with recursion 
17 Merge sort (all sorting algo are important)
18. Find max sum subarray
19. find average pair or sum of pair in array basically check if target 8 can be made from given array [2,7,4,1]
20. valida anagram example ('aaz,'aza' is valid)
21.count unique string in array
22. check if given parentheseis string is valid means '{{{[}}]}' this is valid parenthesis string
23. reverese a numbe -321 to -123
24 min swaps issue example ('][][') how many swaps required to make valid statement like ('[][]')   -->
<!-- Q1. Write a polyfill for bind function.
Q2. Given an expression string exp , write a program to examine whether the pairs and the orders of “{“,”}”,”(“,”)”,”[“,”]” are correct in exp.
Example:
Input: expz = “[()]{}{[()()]()}”m
Output: Balanced
Input: exp = “[(])”
Output: Not Balanced
Q3. What is the output of below program and Explain about your output
for (var i = 1; i less than 5; i+as z+) {
           setTimeout(() greater than or equal to console.log(i), 1000) 
 }
F2F (Round 1 - DataStructure and Algorithm)
Q4. Write a program for debounce function.
Q1. What is Doctype?
Ans: The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is used to inform a website visitor's browser that the document being rendered is an HTML document. While not actually an HTML element itself, every HTML document should be with a DOCTYPE declaration to be compliant with HTML standards.
Q2. How many types of storage?
Q3. If there is a for loop running over some time and your browser is not responding on that particular time. What will you do to make browser available and always responding to the user?
Q4. What is Service worker
Q5. What is Defer and async
Q6. What is box model
Q7. What is the difference between inline vs inline-block
Q8. What is the difference between absolute vs relative position
Q9. How can you align a div at center
Q10. What is the difference between svg vs canvas
Q11. What is pseudo-class
https://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2012/08/pseudo-classes-vs-pseudo-elements.html
Q12. Hoisting
Q13. What is difference between function expression and function declaration
Q14. Closure
if(i===1 && i === 2 && i === 3)
console.log(“yes”)
else console.log(“yes”)
What will you implement " i " so that we always get “yes”
Q15. Write a program for sum(1)(2)
Q16. What is the difference between forEach vs map
Q17. What the multiple ways to create object
Q18. What is the difference between Object.create vs new
Q19. What is the difference between Shallow copy vs Deep copy
Q20. Write a program for shallow compare vs deep compare
Q21. What is the difference between  __proto__ vs prototype

function Person(name){
    this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.sayHello = function(){
    console.log(this.name)
}

const person1 = new Person('heeloo');
const person2 = new Person('hlllll');

const obj1 = {
    name:'sdds',
    rollno:12
}

const obj2 = {
    __proto__ : obj1

}

console.log(obj2.name)

Q22. What is the prototype chain
Q23. What is Prototype inheritance
Q24. What is Promise, Why we should have to use it instead of call back
Q25. What is Async await
Q26. What is event capturing vs event bubbling
Q27. How to enable event capturing
Q28. What is the difference between prevent default vs stop propagation
Q29. Since both promise and setTimeout is async function which will execute first if both is available in queue at time T.
Promise.resolve schedules a microtask and the setTimeout schedules a macrotask. And the microtasks are executed before running the next macrotask.
Q30. what is job queue
Q31. ES6 feature - What is arrow function and when we have to use it, How it is different from normal function -->


<!-- The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written
in.This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers. -->
