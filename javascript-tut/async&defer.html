<!-- defer
The defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for the script. Instead, the browser will continue to 
process the HTML, build DOM. The script loads “in the background”, and then runs when the DOM is fully built. -->
<!-- Scripts with defer never block the page.
Scripts with defer always execute when the DOM is ready (but before DOMContentLoaded event). -->

<!-- async scripts load in the background and run when ready. The DOM and other scripts don’t wait for them, and they don’t wait for anything. 
 A fully independent script that runs when loaded. As simple, as it can -->


<!-- Async - means execute code when it is downloaded and do not block DOM construction during downloading process.
Defer - means execute code after it's downloaded and browser finished DOM construction and rendering process. -->

async
Purpose: Loads the script asynchronously, meaning the script will be fetched in the background while the HTML parsing continues.
Execution: Once the script is downloaded, it will execute immediately, pausing the HTML parsing to run the script.
This can be useful for scripts that do not depend on the rest of the HTML or other scripts.
Use Case: Use async when the script can be executed independently of other scripts and doesn't rely on the DOM being fully parsed.
Examples include analytics scripts or other third-party scripts.

defer
Purpose: Loads the script in the background while the HTML parsing continues.
Execution: The script will execute only after the HTML parsing is complete. This ensures that the entire
DOM is available to the script.
Use Case: Use defer for scripts that need to interact with the DOM or depend on other scripts being executed
first. It ensures a predictable order of execution.
