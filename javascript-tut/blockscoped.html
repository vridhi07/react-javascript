// what is block in js?
// block is also knowns as compound statement 
{
    //compound statement 
}
// a block is used to combined multiple javascript code into one statement or multiple code into a group
// group of statement is used in a place where javascript except one statement

// block scope means what all function and variable access inside block
// let and const are hoisted in block scope and var is hoisted in global scope //let and const are not accessible outside the block

// three scopes //1)block scope 2) global scope 3) script scope
// what is shadowing in javascript
// when a variable is declared in a certain scope having the same name defined on its outer scope This is known as Shadowing or 
// Variable Shadowing. 
//and when we call the variable from the inner scope, the value assigned to the variable in the inner scope 
// is the value that will be stored in the variable in the memory space. 

// in case of var

//b and c hoisted in script scope
let b =20;
const c =30;

//b and c hoisted in block scopee
{
  let b =20;
 const c =30;
}

{
  var a =10;
  let b =20;
  const c =30;
  console.log(a); //o/p 10
  console.log(b); //o/p 20
  console.log(c); //o/p 30
}
console.log(a); //o/p 10 because a is in global scope
console.log(b); // reference error b is not defined because b is in block scope and block is now gone 
console.log(c);


// shadowing


var a =100;
{ 
  var a = 10;  //this variable shadows var a = 100 variable and change variable a to 10 because they both pointed to same memory locations global memory
  let b = 20;
  const c = 30;
  console.log(a); // o/p 10
  console.log(b);// o/p 20
  console.log(c);// o/p 30
 }
console.log(a); // o/p 10

var d= 100; // global scope
function a()
{
 var d = 10; //local scope
 console.log(d)//10;
}
a();
console.log(d)//100

// in case of let
let b =100; // it is not in block or global scope it is in script scope
{ 
  var a = 10; 
  let b = 20; //this variable shadows let b = 100 variable this is in block scope
  const c = 30;
  console.log(a); // o/p 10
  console.log(b); // o/p 20
  console.log(c);// o/p 30
 }
console.log(b); // o/p 100


// in case of const
const c =100; // it is not in block or global scope it is in script scope
{ 
  var a = 10; 
  let b = 20; 
  const c = 30;//this variable shadows var c = 100 variable
  console.log(a); // o/p 10
  console.log(b); // o/p 20
  console.log(c);// o/p 30
 }
console.log(c); // o/p 100

const c = 100; 
function x(){ 
  const c = 30;
  console.log(c);// o/p 30
}
 x();
console.log(c); // o/p 100



// illegal shadowing 
let a = 20
{
    var a = 20; // synatx error  a is already declared
}

var a = 20
{
    let a = 20; // perfectly valid
}
