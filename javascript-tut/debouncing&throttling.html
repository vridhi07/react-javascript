<!-- Debouncing -------- 
The major difference between debouncing and throttling is that debounce calls a function 
when a user (hasnâ€™t carried out an event) in a specific amount of time, while throttle calls a 
function at intervals of a specified amount of time (while the user is carrying out an event). 

In the debouncing technique, no matter how many times the user fires the event, the attached function will be
executed only after the specified time once the user (stops firing the event). jb stop krde event fire krna uske specific time interval mei api call hogi

Throttling is a technique in which, no matter how many times the user fires the event, the attached 
function will be executed only once in a (given time interval). jo usko time interval diya h uske 
baad event fire hoga


debouncing and Throttling both used for optimising performance of web apps  we can achieve this by 
limiting rate of function call
debouncing means only make an api call if the difference between two key press events is greater than 
certain limits , throttling means only call api after certain limit time
