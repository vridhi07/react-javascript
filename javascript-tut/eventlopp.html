  //browser contain js engine javascript is a synchronous single threaded language it has one call stack ,
  //it can do one thing at a time this call stack is present inside js engine all operation perform inside
  //call stack, whenever any javascript prorgram execute the global execution context is created, call
  //stack doesnot have a timer so it doesnot perform operation which is excecuted after 5 sec

  //browser -> jsengine -> callstack -> where all the programs run

  //web apis -> setTimeout() , Dom-Api (document.getElment), fetch() , localstorage , console , location

  // all web apis  is not a part of javascript only browser have this apis gave access with the help of global object window
  // [eg : window.setTimeout] to jsengine to use them , window.setTimeout and settimeout both is same thing

  console.log("Start"); // firstly GEC is created then call web api console  and print start on console
  setTimeout(function cb() {
    console.log("callback");
  }, 5000);
  console.log("end");

  //setTimeout call setTimeout web api which gave access to timer feature and it registered the callBack
  //soon as timer expires ,this callback method needs to go inside call stack, but it directly not go inside callstack,
  //it go to call stack through call back queue , when time expire it go to call back queue
  // event loop check the call queue and put the function into call stack
  // all the functions which comes from promises go inside the microtask and it has higher priority
  // The MutationObserver interface provides the ability to watch for changes being made to the DOM tree.
  //starvation of task inside call back queue
