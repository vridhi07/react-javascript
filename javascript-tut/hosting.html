<!-- Execution context, in simple words, is the environment that a function executes in. 
Every function in javascript has its own execution context.
All execution contexts have a creation phase and an execution phase.
In the creation phase, the execution context exhibits a behavior called hoisting.
Hoisting is the behavior of moving all the declarations at the top of the scope before code
execution which happens in the execution phase. The javascript engine goes through the
code and looks for all “var”s and “function”s and declares them, initializing to undefined,
before actually starting to execute the statements. In other words, 
it assigns memory for all vars and functions in the code before executing the code statements. 


The JavaScript engine before parses the code before executing and during the parsing phase it shifts 
all the variable declaration to the top of the scope. This behavior of the JS engine is called hoisting.

let and const are hoisted too. But the difference is that they are not initialized, unlike var
which is initialized to undefined. Hence, let or const should be used instead of var to avoid hoisting 
side effects as shown in the below snippet. This is because it would throw an exception since it would 
not allow animal to be used before its declaration.

//the below code snippet will print out undefined. 
//only global variable attached to windows

var a = 10;
console.log(window.a);

let numbers = [4,2,6];
numbers.sort((a,b) =>
{
    console.log(a);
    console.log(b);

} );
console.log(numbers);
