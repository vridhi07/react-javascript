// localStorage data does not have an expiration date by default.
// It persists indefinitely until it is explicitly deleted by the application or the user.
// This means that data stored in localStorage will remain even if the user closes the browser,
// restarts their computer, or comes back to the website days, months, or years later.
// However, you can implement your own expiration logic by storing a timestamp along with the data and
// checking it each time you access the data.

// sessionStorage data is designed to persist only for the duration of the page session.
//This means that the data stored in sessionStorage is automatically cleared when the page session ends.
//A page session ends when the browser tab or window is closed.
//data is automatically cleared when the browser tab or window is closed
// Because sessionStorage is meant to be temporary and tied to a single session, there is no built-in mechanism
// to set an explicit expiration date. The data will always expire as soon as the tab or window is closed.

// Cookies can have an expiration date, which determines how long they persist.
//If no expiration date is set, the cookie is considered a session cookie and will expire when the browser is closed.

  //The JSON.stringify() method converts a JavaScript object or value to a JSON string
  //In JSON, keys must be strings, written with double quotes  {"name":"John"}
  //In JavaScript, keys can be strings, numbers, or identifier names: {name:"John"}
