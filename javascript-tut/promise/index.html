<!--Javascript is synchoronous single threaded language of if we want to wait for some code to run after some time we use callback-->
<!--with the help of callback we can do asynchronous thing in javascript-->

A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of a particular task or event.
it ensuring that certain code executes after a specific task has been completed.

Disadvantages of Callbacks
Callback Hell:hen callbacks are nested within other callbacks multiple levels deep, it creates a structure that is hard to read and maintain.
This phenomenon is known as "callback hell" or the "pyramid of doom."
Error Handling:: Error handling with callbacks can be cumbersome. Each callback needs to handle errors explicitly
Inversion of Control::With callbacks, you hand over control of your function to another function, which can lead to issues
if not properly managed. The callback function execution is dependent on the external function's implementation.

Alternatives to Callbacks
Promises:
Async/Await:




<script>
    // ex1
    console.log('sysnc');

    setTimeout(()=> {   //callback function
        for(let index=0; index<12; index++)
        {
            const element = index;
            console.log("this is the number" + element);
        }
    },100);

    console.log('done printing');

    // ex2

    const cart = ["shoes","pant" ,"kurta"];
    api.createdOrder();


    // we want to call proceed to payment after the order is created after payment is successfully need to show payment page

    //callback

    api.createdOrder(cart,function() { //passing callback function to another functions -> we pass this function and createdOrder api call this function when ever they want to call
        api.proceedToPayment(function() {
            api.orderSummaryPage()
        })
    });

    const promise = createdOrder(cart);

    promise.then(function , (orderId){
        proceedToPayment(orderId) // we are attaching call back to promise object means it gurantee that whenever we get data in promise object then proceed to payment function call
    })

    //promise chain

    createdOrder(order)
        .then((orderId) => proceedToPayment(orderId))
        .then((paymentInfo) => showOrderSummaryPaymentInfo(paymentInfo))
        .then((paymentInfo) => updateWalletInfo(paymentInfo))
