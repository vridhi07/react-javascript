//scope means where you can access specifice function or variable in a code
// whenever an execution context is created a lexical environmanet is also created
// lexical environment is a local memory along with lexical environment of its parent
// A lexical environment  holds a memory + reference to a parent lexical environment.
// lexical in hierachy // c is lexical present inside a or a is lexical inside global scope
// lexical environment of a is c , lexical environment of anonyms is a
// scope chain is finding variables present in a every excution context the wholw chain of lexical environment
// is known as scope chain
//lexical parent menas where actually that parent sit inside the code
//a scope = local memory + lexical env of global

// lexical environmet of a is local memory + lexical envi of parent
