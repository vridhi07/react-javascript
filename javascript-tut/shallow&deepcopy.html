  //deep copying vs. shallow copying. A deep copy means that all of the values of the new variable are copied
  //and disconnected from the original variable. A shallow copy means that certain (sub-)values are still
  //connected to the original variable.

  //Lodash To Deep Copy: Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides multiple utility functions and one of
  // the most commonly used function of the Lodash library is the cloneDeep() method. This method helps in
  //deep cloning of an object and also clones the non serializable properties which were a limitation in the

  // Shallow Copy: When a reference variable is copied into a new reference variable using the assignment operator,
  // a shallow copy of the referenced object is created. In simple words, a reference variable mainly stores the
  // address of the object it refers to. When a new reference variable is assigned the value of the old reference
  // variable, the address stored in the old reference variable is copied into the new one. This means both the
  // old and new reference variable point to the same object in memory. As a result if the state of the object
  // changes through any of the reference variables it is reflected for both.

  // Deep Copy: Unlike the shallow copy, deep copy makes a copy of all the members of the old object,allocates
  // separate memory location for the new object and then assigns the copied members to the new object.
